# CS_289_Project_T_Team_CCMJ

This project aims to introduce the students to polynomial regression to learn non-linear decision boundaries. In this project, students will 
* create their own polynomial features by lifting and perform polynomial regression on various data sets,
* observe and understand overfitting and underfitting in the context of different degrees of polynomials, 
* practice kernel trick and see how it improves computation speed for higher-order polynomials. 
* preprocess real-life data to get better training results
* get familiar with Sklearn package and use their polynomial regression and kernel regression functions


This assignment is designed to be completed in week 4 of EECS 16ML. We assumed that the students have ample understanding of linear regression and have tried running or implementing it, as it is assigned in week 2 of the class. We also assumed that the students know the basics of kernels as it is also introduced in week 4. To consolidate student's understanding and make sure that they are well prepared for the kernel trick portion of this assignment, we made a conceptual review on polynomial kernels in our teaching note. The goal is that after the assignment, students will not only be familar with kernels conceptually, but also have the experience of working with kernels themselves. Cross-validation and bias-variance tradeoff are introduced in week 2. In this assignment, the students will practice these concepts in the context fo polynomial regression. We added respective sections in our teaching note to help them review these topics and to make sure that they fully understand those topic after completing this assignment. 

The notebook **Polynomial regression assignment.ipynb** in the **Assignment** folder is the coding assignment. In the same folder, you can find the data files you need to run the assignment codes. Please download them along **Polynomial regression assignment.ipynb** but you wouldn't need to make any modifications to them. **Assignment instructions.pdf** in the same folder contains background information regarding the assignment and the data sets that you may find useful.  The solution to this assignment can be found in the **Solution** folder. 

In the root folder, you can find the following supplementary files:
**teaching notes: polynomial regression** provides conceptual explanation on the key concepts covered in this assignment. Students can reinforce their understanding of relavant topics by reading through this file.
**slide deck: polynomial regression** serves as teaching slides for a potential lecture on learning non-linear boundaries using polynomial regression
