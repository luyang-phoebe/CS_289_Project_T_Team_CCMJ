# CS_289_Project_T_Team_CCMJ

This project aims to introduce the students to polynomial regression. In this project, students will 
* create their own polynomial features by lifting and perform polynomial regression on various data sets,
* observe and understand overfitting and underfitting in the context of different degrees of polynomials, 
* be introduced to the kernel trick and how it improves computation speed for higher-order polynomials. 

The notebook **Polynomial regression assignmnet.ipynb** in the **Assignment** folder contains the coding assignment. **Assignment instructions.pdf** in the same folder contains background information regarding the assignment and the data sets that you may find useful. The other files in the **Assignment** folder contains the data sets that you will use. Please download them along **Polynomial regression assignmnet.ipynb** but you wouldn't need to make any modifications to them. The solution to this assignment can be found in the **Solution** folder.
