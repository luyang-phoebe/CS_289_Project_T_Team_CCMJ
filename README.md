# CS_289_Project_T_Team_CCMJ

This project aims to introduce the students to polynomial regression. In this project, students will create their own polynomial features and perform polynomial regression on various data sets. Overfitting and underfitting will be introduced in the context of choosing the degree of polynomials. The project also taps a little into using the kernel trick to improve compuation speed.
